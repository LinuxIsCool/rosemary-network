# Rosemary Network

I'm having fun with javascript! I found an awesome collection
of solar punk inspired art on 4chan. 4chan does not archive data,
it disappears after a certain amount of time, so there is no link.
I downloaded the images that many people had posted in this thread,
and I have compiled it here. I have not made any of these images and
I give full credit to the authors. If any authors are identified, I
encourage someone to push to this readme, giving credit where possible. 

Particular inspiration for this piece comes from three people, 
ETH-master Aidono, Stuart Stretch, and Teien Vanessa.
